### What we think-_The Last Supper_
 The outlook and depiction of the _Last Supper_ has changed over the centuries and this piece itself has shown adaptation everytime it is recreated or restored. Leonardo da Vinci's art is one of the most well know and he started creation in 1495 with the image that it would be a view inside Jesus'last meal before his crucifixion. The idea was for it  to represent _Holy Communion_ and there have been many changes in that idea,and what Da Vinci was really trying to express according to today's analysis. 
 Coming from a Christian Background I saw copies of this in church, family members homes and even in places of business, but never realizing how much it has changed throughout the years, the modern day feeling seems to be more than just a painting about hidden agenda's, it seems to be telling a story about the past and the future. 

### The Rhetoric
Digital Technology has changed the look and meaning behind _The Last Supper_ and people of Christian Faith and other Religions have been able to make changes as they see approprate with time and personal agenda. The simple fact that we can break apart certain pieces of the painting with a zoom on a laptop, watch a video([SmartHistory](https://smarthistory.org/leonardo-last-supper/))(1) or buy a revised copy means that the view can be different for everyone no matter the cultural background.What this has done for the lover of art is made access and analysis incredibly easy, it has also made restoration of the piece a modern "virtual reallity" as Dott Mario Taddei  talks about in his Digital Restoration Article of The Last Supper by Da Vinci.(2) I think that the reallity of historical art is that we have made modern art out of what we see fit, reguardless of the adaptation that may have been used. The simple path that Da Vinci's painting took influenced many religions with the course it has taken for the past 500 years.

### Evolution or Adaptation
 The Leonardo3 Museum has taken Di Vinci's work to a whole new status, the museum have implamented virtual reality, hi resolution and easy access to documentation,this makes priceless pieces of art possible for everyone to experiance. 
  Once the world realized that that _The Last Supper_  was in rapid decay and that only 42% was actual Da Vinci's own work, technology took over. What was thought to be lost was restored and what had never been seen came to life with shape and color.

 ### Digital Works
  Leonardo3 has done amazing things with technology and art, they have taken what was once a murual that is falling to pieces and created digital restored art piece that you can see hear and love in its new form. They have created work know as "The Time Machine" that restored it not only to its origianl form but added more insite and drama to a painting with the help of a computer. They have created apostle and Christ voices that an individual can interact with, it helps to create emotion of what the betrayel was really like that very moment when Christ spoke, it then explores every detail of the painting while capturing it on a screen for you to see.

### Pop Culture
When art does a rebirth with times it changes to what social media and technology want. Social media along with
Pop-culture has done wonders for revitalizing art,may not be thought of as acceptable in the minds of the Art Historian but sit has have changed the way we view a particular piece, _The Last Supper_ is no exception to this rule,
