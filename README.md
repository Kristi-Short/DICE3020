### What we think-_The Last Supper_
  I chose the painting by Leonardo Da Vinci called _The Last Supper_ this is symbolic to me because it shows that there can be love and betrayal within a painting and this piece of art has seen so many changes over the past 500 years. We think we can change what was history by applying technology and creating new meaning.
 Leonardo da Vinci's art is one of the most well known and he started creation in 1495 with the image that it would be a view inside Jesus's last meal before his crucifixion. The idea was for it  to represent _Holy Communion_ and there have been many changes in that idea,and what Da Vinci was really trying to express according to today's art historians. The outlook and depiction of the _Last Supper_ has become altered over the centuries and this piece itself has shown adaptation ever ytime it is recreated or restored.
 Myself, coming from a Christian Background I saw copies of this in church, family members homes and even in places of business, but never realizing how much it had changed throughout the years, the modern day feeling seems to be more than just a painting about hidden agendas, it seems to be telling a story about the past and the future. This story may change with religious identity, age, cultural background and even education.  

### The Rhetoric
  Digital Technology has changed the look and meaning behind _The Last Supper_ and people of Christian Faith and other Religions have been able to make changes as they see appropriate with time and personal agenda. The simple fact that we can break apart certain pieces of the painting with a zoom on a laptop, watch a video([SmartHistory](https://smarthistory.org/leonardo-last-supper/)}(1) or buy a revised copy means that the view can be different for everyone no matter the cultural background.What this has done for the lover of art is made access and analysis incredibly easy, it has also made restoration of the piece a modern "virtual reality" as Dott Mario Taddei  talks about in his Digital Restoration Article of The Last Supper by Da Vinci.(2) I think that the reallity of historical art is that we have made modern art out of what we see fit, regardless of the adaptation that may have been used. The simple path that Da Vinci's painting took influenced many religions with the course it has taken for the past 500 years.

### Evolution or Adaptation
   The Leonardo3 Museum has taken Di Vinci's work to a whole new  cultural status, the museum have implanted virtual reality, Hi resolution and easy access to documentation, this makes A priceless piece of art possible for everyone to experience. This is so important in todays life because a person can not just see that art but they can actually experience the art. 
  Once the world realized that _The Last Supper_  was in rapid decay and that only 42% was actual Da Vinci's own original work, technology had to take over. What was thought to be lost was restored and what had never been seem to come to life with shape and color. The evolution of this painting has been the meaning behind what adaptation has created. This means that with art changing so rapidly by society being able to dissect every stroke and every angle, the artist original meaning has needed to evolve right along with it. Da Vinci's original _Holy Communion_ has now become either symbolic betrayal or hidden timelines for what was thought to be the end. To see the adaptation of _The Last Supper_ with music, videos, and websites you could almost create your own meaning of what Leonardo was trying to say through his expression in his painting.

### Digital Works
 Leonardo3 has also done amazing things with technology and art, they have taken what was once a mural that is falling to pieces and have created a digitally restored master piece that you can now see, hear, and love in its new form. They have created work known as “The Time Machine” that restored it not only to its original form but added more insight and drama to a painting with the help of a computer. What they have created is an apostle and Christ voice that an individual can interact with, it helps to generate emotion of what the betrayal was really like at that very moment when Christ spoke. It then explores every detail of the painting while capturing it on a screen for you to see, showing every art connoisseur what the very images meant. They have brightened the colors giving new life to a dark eating area that was maybe seen has dark and gloomy.[Leonardo3 Info Link](http://www.leonardo3.net/LastSupper-info/)

### Pop Culture
  When art does a rebirth, it changes to what social media and technology want it to be, there are no choices. Social media along with
Pop-culture has done wonders for revitalizing art, although it may not always be thought of as what is acceptable in the minds of the Art Historians, the art critic, or a certain generations, but it does change the rules of art in todays world. These rules have been modified to meet out needs of creativity and adventure within art, and Da Vinci's art is no exception to the rule. There have been countless versions of _The Last Supper_ to accomodate any enthusiast and even videos that play off of Da Vinci's life
